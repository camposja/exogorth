# Star Wars API exercise

Exercise was to consume what Star Wars API:

* When you run the program from the command line (say, ruby alderaan.rb), you are presented with a list of Star Wars movie titles to choose between.

* When a user selects a title, they are presented with the opening crawl for the movie and asked if they would like to learn more or select another title.

* If they choose to select another title, they go back to the list.

* If they wish to learn more, they get a list of characters presented.

* If they choose one of those, they can read a character bio and are asked if they'd like to go back to the movie or to select another title.

* You should have classes that define objects to represent the API responses. If you are testing, these classes should have tests!
